# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ML surrogate modeling framework for Lorenz dynamical systems (L63, L96, L05 Model III). The goal is to train neural networks as fast replacements for numerical ODE integrators in Ensemble Data Assimilation (DA) workflows. Trained surrogates propagate ensemble members through forecast cycles instead of the expensive numerical solver.

## Setup

DAPyr (not on PyPI) must be installed locally **before** installing other dependencies:

```bash
conda activate lorenzo   # project conda environment
pip install DAPyr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For GPU training, `torch` in `requirements.txt` is CPU-only by default — replace with the appropriate CUDA wheel.

## Architecture

### Entry Points

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `0_LorenzDashboard.py` | Dash app — Lorenz trajectory simulator |
| `1_SingleMLTraining.py` | Dash app — full interactive training UI |
| `Main_ML.py` | CLI — batch training from `config.yml` |
| `ML_Model_Comparison.py` | CLI — evaluate and compare saved models |
| `D_EnKF.py` | Script — full EnKF DA experiments with surrogate vs. truth |

### Core Modules

**`MachineLearning.py`** — Four model architectures, all sharing the same interface:
- Input: `(batch, prev_time_steps × state_dim)` — flattened history window (oldest-first)
- Output: `(batch, state_dim)` — predicted next state

| Class | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `DenseNN` | Standard MLP |
| `ResDenseNN` | Residual MLP; predicts Δ, returns `current + Δ` — more stable training |
| `LSTMNN` | LSTM; reshapes input to `(batch, prev_time_steps, state_dim)` internally; `forward` returns `(output, hidden)` |
| `RNN` | Vanilla RNN with same reshaping; `forward` returns `(output, hidden)`; `rnn_nonlinearity` is configurable (`'tanh'`/`'relu'`) |

**`Training.py`** — Training loop and rollout logic:
- `train_model(model, model_name, train_loader, val_loader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs, early_stopping, ..., max_rollout_steps, gamma, stateful_rollout, initial_lr, lr_phase_decay, lr_scheduler_patience, lr_scheduler_factor)` — gradient-descent loop; returns `(trained_model, history)`
- `recursive_rollout(model, initial_input, num_steps, prev_time_steps, device, stateful_rollout=False)` → `(batch, num_steps, nx)` — autoregressive rollout; when `stateful_rollout=True` and model has `stateful=True`, hidden state is threaded across steps (BPTT). Window shifts each step (drop oldest, append prediction).
- Multi-step loss: `Σ γ^s · loss_s`; γ defaults to 0.9 but is configurable via `training.rollout_gamma`
- `EarlyStopping` — patience-based; when patience is exhausted and `rollout_steps < max_rollout_steps`, the phase advances (`rollout_steps += 1`), optimizer state is cleared, LR is decayed by `lr_phase_decay`, and a fresh `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler is created. Training only stops when patience is exhausted at `max_rollout_steps`.
- Within each phase, `ReduceLROnPlateau` (patience=`lr_scheduler_patience`, factor=`lr_scheduler_factor`) reduces LR on plateau.
- Validation uses the **same `rollout_steps`** as the current training phase — there is no separate fixed validation depth.
- No gradient clipping is applied; stability for recurrent models is managed via the progressive phase schedule and `stateful_rollout`.

**`datasets/LorenzDataset.py`** — PyTorch Dataset:
- Generates trajectories via `LorenzSystems.generate_trajectory_fast()` (DAPyr + numbalsoda)
- Caches per-trajectory `.npz` files in `dataset_cache/` keyed by a hash of the full dataset config — any config change invalidates the cache
- Fits `StandardScaler` on training data; normalization stats saved with model checkpoint
- Sample: input = `data[i-prev_time_steps:i].flatten()`, target = next `_MAX_FUTURE=10` steps
- Valid index caching prevents samples from crossing trajectory boundaries (different ICs)

**`lorenz/lorenz_systems.py`** — DAPyr integration layer:
- `LorenzSystems.generate_trajectory_fast()` — preferred; single batch call to SUNDIALS via numbalsoda
- `LorenzSystems.generate_trajectory()` — legacy per-step loop (slower, avoid)
- Caches DAPyr RHS function pointers by `(system_type, params)` to avoid Numba recompilation

**`SurrogateModel.py`** — Inference wrapper:
- Loads any checkpoint, reconstructs architecture from metadata
- Handles normalization/denormalization internally; users always work in physical space
- `predict(history)` → next state `(N,)`; `rollout(history, n_steps)` → `(n_steps, N)`; calling the object (`surrogate(history)`) aliases `predict`
- Auto-discovers `.yml` sidecar next to `.pth` for full config reconstruction

**`EnKF_core.py`** — Core EnKF logic (imported by `D_EnKF.py`):
- `EnKFConfig` — dataclass for all tunable parameters
- `run_enkf(forecast_fn, xt_0, Xf_pool, config)` — runs full DA cycle; `forecast_fn` wraps either `SurrogateModel` or ground-truth Lorenz
- `make_surrogate_forecaster(surrogate, M)` / `make_lorenz_forecaster(dt, M)` — factory functions for `forecast_fn`; **note: `make_lorenz_forecaster` is currently hardcoded for L63 only**
- Supports stochastic EnKF and deterministic ETKF, multiplicative inflation, Gaspari-Cohn localization

**`D_EnKF.py`** — EnKF experiment orchestrator:
- Imports from `EnKF_core.py`, runs 5 benchmark sweeps: baseline, M, Ne, p (observed fraction), σ_obs
- Figures output to `figures/`

**`EnKFConfig`** key fields:
```python
T=30          # DA cycles
M=10          # forecast steps between assimilation
Ne=20         # ensemble size
dt=0.01
p=1.0         # fraction of observed state vars
sig_obs=1.1   # observation error std
enkf_type='stochastic'  # or 'deterministic' (ETKF)
use_localization=False; loc_radius=3.0
use_inflation=False;    infl_factor=1.02
```

**`plotting_helpers.py`** — Matplotlib/Plotly utilities for EnKF output (RMSE curves, rank histograms, spread-skill plots). Consumed by `D_EnKF.py`; not called from training code.

**`verify/`** — Standalone analysis scripts (not part of the main pipeline):
- `spread_visualizations.py` — ensemble spread plots for saved surrogates
- `model_surrogate_skill.py` — spectral/statistical skill metrics (power spectra, skewness, kurtosis) for surrogate vs truth
- `surrogate_ensemble_skill.py` — ensemble skill evaluation
- `dataset_validation.py` — validates cached `.npz` dataset files in `dataset_cache/`
- These scripts use hardcoded model paths (in `models/`) and must be updated manually when new checkpoints are trained.

### Data Flow

```
config.yml
  └─▶ LorenzDataset
        ├─ DAPyr RK45/LSODA integrator (numbalsoda)
        ├─ Cache .npz per trajectory (hash-keyed)
        └─ StandardScaler normalization
  └─▶ DataLoader (train/val/test 70/20/10)
  └─▶ Model (DenseNN | ResDenseNN | LSTMNN | RNN)
        ├─ recursive_rollout with progressive depth
        └─ Multi-step loss (γ decay, configurable)
  └─▶ Checkpoint .pth + sidecar .yml

```

### Model Checkpoint Format

`.pth` contains: `model_state_dict`, `train_mean`, `train_std`, `architecture` dict.  
`.yml` sidecar stores the full training config for reproducibility.  
Filenames: `{ModelType}_L{system}_trial{n}_{timestamp}.pth`.

## Configuration (`config.yml`)

Controls all batch training parameters. `1_SingleMLTraining.py` GUI exposes the same knobs.

## Key Constraints

- **Fixed state dimensions**: L96 is always N=40, L05 is always N=480 — hardcoded in DAPyr's Numba kernels. L63 is N=3.
- **Normalization**: Always normalize inputs with saved `train_mean`/`train_std`; denormalize predictions. `SurrogateModel` does this automatically — raw models do not.
- **Thread management**: `1_SingleMLTraining.py` sets `OMP/MKL/NUMBA_NUM_THREADS=1` to prevent oversubscription with its `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
- **Validation rollout**: Uses the same `rollout_steps` as the current training phase — there is no separate fixed validation depth. Both train and val loss are computed with the current phase's depth.
- **Cache invalidation**: The dataset cache key covers the full dataset config dict. Changing any dataset parameter (dt, ns, system_params, etc.) will trigger regeneration of all trajectory files.
- **Recurrent model hidden state**: `LSTMNN` and `RNN` return `(output, hidden)` tuples. When `stateful_rollout=True`, `recursive_rollout` threads hidden state across autoregressive steps; when `False`, hidden resets per step. Hidden state always resets at the start of every sample/batch — consistent with DA usage where each forecast cycle starts fresh via `SurrogateModel.rollout` (which calls `reset_hidden()` internally).
